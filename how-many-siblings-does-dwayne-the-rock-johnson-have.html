Since his family tree is front and center in the series, some are wondering if the Rock has any siblings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/the-rock.jpg><h2 id=h-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-grew-up-with-his-mother-and-father>Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson grew up with his mother and father</h2><p id=par-3_55>As many fans know, Dwayne Johnson is part of wrestling dynasty with branches on both sides of his family. His maternal grandfather, High Chief Peter Maivia, rose to prominence in the 1970s in the WWE. Maivia was one of the people who trained Rock’s father, Rocky Johnson, in how to get down in the ring.</p><p id=par-4_54>Years later, Johnson would go on to marry Maivia’s daughter Ata against the High Chief’s wishes. He didn’t approve of their relationship because Johnson was a wrestler, and he didn’t want his daughter to deal with the hardships that came with the profession. There was an estrangement until Dwayne Johnson was born in 1972.</p><p id=par-5_39>The elder Johnson’s career kept him on the road, and he would often take Ata and Dwayne with him. It’s something the Rock’s spoken about in interviews where he revealed how often his family moved during his childhood.</p><p id=par-6_16>But he learned plenty about the sport by sitting ringside and through his father’s firsthand teachings.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 id=h-the-rock-has-2-siblings>The Rock has 2 siblings</h2><p id=par-7_54>Though the Rock grew up with his mom and dad in the U.S., his father was a native of Canada. Born Wayde Douglas Bowles in Nova Scotia, he first took up boxing before training to become a wrestler. And he later changed his name to reflect his favorite boxers: Jack Johnson and Rocky Marciano.</p><p id=par-8_44>Before moving to the U.S. to pursue a wrestling career full time, Johnson was in a relationship with a woman named Una. He wrote about her in his autobiography, Soulman: The Rocky Johnson Story. They married and had two children: Curtis and Wanda Bowles.</p><p id=par-9_18>Johnson eventually filed for a divorce from Una and married Ata in 1978, whom he divorced in 2003.</p><h2 id=h-the-rock-s-siblings-maintain-privacy>The Rock’s siblings maintain privacy</h2><p id=par-10_44>When Rocky Johnson was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008, he thanked all three of his children, Curtis, Wanda, and Dwayne. Though the Rock’s brother and sister keep a low profile, Curtis Bowles spoke out after his father’s death in 2020.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_58>He talked to Canada’s <a href=#>CBC </a>about Johnson’s legacy and praised him for breaking barriers in wrestling. I’ve seen him work hard all his life,” said Bowles. “I’ve seen him held down at certain times until he had to work twice as hard because of racial barriers.” He said he considered his father and his friends as his idols.</p><p id=par-12_48>“Huge to me was André the Giant … or my dad. That was huge,” he said. “You see things in a different perspective when you … grow up with larger than life figures.” Bowles said in spite of his father’s achievements, he was still just “Dad” to him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMppinsV2otqO4yKeerGWUpLK0ecOwmLKmlWK3sLTNrKanZZiWw6Z6x62kpWc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./young-dolph-s-track-get-away-released-where-to-listen-it.html>&#171;&nbsp;Young Dolphs Track Get Away Released: Where To Listen It?</a>
