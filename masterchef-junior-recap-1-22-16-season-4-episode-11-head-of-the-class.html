Apparently Amaya’s mother, Avery’s papa, Zac’s mom, and Addison’s mom had all been flown in to act as surprise guests. And so it was nice that the parents got to be there for their kids.</p><p>Because after all, these kids are still pretty young and so a hug from mom or dad went a long way towards boosting them up. And after they had said goodbye to their parents, they were still had to go ahead with their mystery box challenge. As in each contestant was given a box that contained one ingredient they had to use for their next recipe. Which in this case had to be their own take on Christina’s basic recipe for soufflé.</p><p>So Amaya had been given a batch of Dark Chocolate, Zac had been a given batch of Milk Chocolate, Avery had been given a batch of Strawberries, and Addison had been a given of Blackberries. And therefore they each had to not only learn how to cook a soufflé but also how perfect enough in one night with their main ingredient in order to impress the judges. As well as cook it in under forty-five minutes.</p><p>And so it’s safe to say there was a bit of blind panic in the kitchens. The kids were thankfully smart enough to realize they should probably make more than one soufflé in case one of their dishes didn’t turn out too well however the main problem with soufflés was the part where everybody had to sit back and just pray it would rise. Though, in Zac’s case, that ended up taking longer than necessary and even had worried the judges.</p><p>His soufflé kind of turned out to be the lowest out of all of them. And Addison proved to be the highest but no matter what it all came down to the taste. Like did they use their main ingredient correctly and was the soufflé still light enough to be considered soufflé?</p><p>So the judges first tasted all the dishes and then deliberated amongst themselves. Though there was the odd question here or there like whether or not any of the kids first tasted their main ingredient before cooking with it. And thus it wasn’t that much of surprise when Addison won.</p><p>She had made a blackberry soufflé first by tasting the blackberries which was how she was able to determine how much sugar she should use. And that had also given her the idea to add lemon juice to increase the acidity in her dish. Therefore, her soufflé both sounded and tasted delicious.</p><p>And that’s why she was given a leg-up for the next part of the night. Addison you see got to pick which protein her fellow competitors were allowed to cook with and she decided to use the opportunity to try and knock out Zac. Whom she considered to be her toughest competition.</p><p>Addison had gone on to choose ribs for herself, pork loin for Amaya, pork belly for Avery, and pork ears of all things for Zac. Pork ears was literally one of the hardest things to cook. It was mostly pieces of flesh and could be considered stringy if not properly cooked. And so in spite of all that Zac did to try and alleviate the dish – his pork ears did go on to ruin his plate because they had been undercooked.</p><p>However, Avery had surprised everyone. She somehow had gotten it into her head to cook pork belly with sweet potatoes and beets. And that had wowed the judges.</p><p>They simply loved her dish and she was considered to be the favorite of the night because while Addison may have chosen the easier ribs, she hadn’t exactly plated her dish well. Meanwhile Amaya had undercooked her tenderloin and Zac’s pig ears had been a chewy mess.</p><p>And so the first person to be told they made it into the grand finale had been Avery but Avery is going to have to go against Addison.</p><p>Addison the is better baker though Avery is the better cook. So when the two square off next week it’s going to be a sight to see.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG9nnZbAtbHRnJ%2Benl2fwq%2B1zqtkq52Tlr1ufZFraG9lo5qutLvNZmtmnaCewLCwxGZoamWYmq6lec6fZK2glWKwra3SrGY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sarah-vine-duchess-meghan-s-eyes-are-utterly-devoid-of-emotion-or-empathy.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sarah Vine: Duchess Meghans eyes are utterly devoid of emotion or empathy</a>
