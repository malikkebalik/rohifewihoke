He later said of the experience, "After two days, I had a belting headache and could hardly see anymore. I was faint and trembling with hunger and I went to them, 'This is ridiculous. I'm on holiday and you've made me ill. You're going to have to give me some food.'" In 2014, James was a signatory on a letter to "The Guardian" newspaper that expressed support for the idea of Scotland voting against independence from the U.K.</p><p>In 2020, May became half-owner of The Royal Oak pub in Swallowcliffe Wiltshire, which has been around since the early 18th century.
