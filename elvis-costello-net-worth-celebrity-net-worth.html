Worth">Elvis</a> Costello, OBE, is an English singer-songwriter who has a net worth of $70 million dollars. Costello is best known as both a solo artist and as the frontman for the band Elvis Costello and the Attractions. His debut album "My Aim is True" was critically acclaimed when it was released in 1977. After that recording, he formed a backing band called the Attractions, and the group toured for nearly a decade before splitting in 1986. Elvis has had many enduring hit songs including "Alison" (1977), "Watching the Detectives" (1977), "Pump It Up" (1978), "Everyday I Write the Book" (1983), and "Veronica" (1989).</p><p>He has also appeared in several film and television products, such as "The <a href=# title="Larry Sanders Net Worth">Larry Sanders</a> Show" (1994), "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" (1999), "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby" (2006), and "30 Rock" (2009). Costello was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003, and in 2019, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Elvis published his memoir, "Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink," in 2015.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Elvis Costello was born Declan Patrick MacManus on August 25, 1954, in Paddington, London, England. His parents, Lilian and Ross, split up when he was 7 years old. Ross was a jazz musician, and his 1970 cover version of the Beatles' "The Long and Winding Road" (under the name Day Costello) was a hit in Australia. MacManus studied at St. Edmund's Catholic Primary School and Archbishop Myers Secondary Modern R.C. School before moving to Birkenhead with Lilian in 1971. There, he formed the folk duo Rusty with Allan Mayes. After graduating from Liverpool's St. Francis Xavier's College, he worked office jobs to make ends meet, then moved back home to London in 1974. MacManus formed the band Flip City that year, and the group stayed together until early 1976. Also in 1974, he co-starred in a R. White's Lemonade commercial with his father, and the ad won a silver award at the International Advertising Festival. Calling himself D.P. Costello, he signed a contract with Stiff Records, an independent label, in 1976. His manager, Jake Riviera, suggested the first name Elvis, and "Elvis Costello" was born.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Costello released his first single with Stiff, "Less Than Zero," in March 1977, and when the album "My Aim Is True" came out four months later, it reached #14 on the UK Albums Chart. Since his first album wasn't released outside of the U.K., Elvis once busked outside a convention of CBS Records executives in London, and though he was arrested, he ended up with a record deal with Columbia Records, CBS a few months later. By the end of 1977, Costello formed the Attractions, his permanent backing band: pianist Steve Nieve, bassist Bruce Thomas, and drummer Pete Thomas. In December 1977, Elvis Costello and the Attractions were banned from "Saturday Night Live" when they played "Radio Radio" instead of the agreed-upon "Less Than Zero." The ban ended in 1989, and the performance led to a surge in Costello's popularity in the U.S. Elvis released two more albums in the 1970s: "This Year's Model" (1978) and "Armed Forces" (1979), which peaked #4 and #2, respectively, on the UK Albums Chart. "Armed Forces" was certified Platinum in the U.K. and Gold in the United States.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-198798 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Elvis-Costello.jpg alt="Elvis Costello Net Worth" width=594 height=388 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-198798 class=wp-caption-text>Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images</p><p>Costello kicked off the '80s with the album "Get Happy!!" and released eight more by the end of the decade, including "Punch the Clock" (1983), "Goodbye Cruel World" (1984), and "Spike" (1989).

In 1999, Costello appeared on "Saturday Night Live's" 25th anniversary special, performing "Radio Radio" with the Beastie Boys as his backing band. Elvis has released 12 studio albums since 2001, including 2002's "When I Was Cruel" and 2013's "Wise Up Ghost," a collaboration with the Roots.

Elvis became a vegetarian after seeing the documentary "The Animals Film" in the early 1980s, and he is a fan of Premier League football, supporting Liverpool F.C since his youth. In 2018, he was forced to cancel the end of his European tour while he was recovering from surgery to treat a "small but very aggressive cancerous malignancy." Costello is a member of the Board of Directors of the Jazz Foundation of America. He has been working with the Jazz Foundation since 2001 and has performed at their annual A Great Night in Harlem benefit numerous times.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Costello has been nominated for 14 Grammys, winning Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album for "Look Now" in 2020.
