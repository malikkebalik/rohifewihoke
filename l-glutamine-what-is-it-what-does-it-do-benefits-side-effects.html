Amino acids and proteins play many vital roles in our body. Specifically, glutamine helps with the transport of carbon and nitrogen (used for cell division and growth) in our bodies and plays roles in neural function, intestinal function, and boosting our immune system.&nbsp;</p><p>It is made by the body in our muscle tissue and is therefore considered “non-essential”. This means that we don’t have to strictly consume it from our diet. However, when our body is under physical (metabolic) stress, it may require more glutamine than it makes on its own.&nbsp;</p><p>This need for additional glutamine, when our body is using it in higher amounts, supports the argument that&nbsp;L-glutamine is actually “conditionally essential” – meaning there are times when it’s necessary to consume more than what our body produces.&nbsp;</p><p>It makes sense that making our muscles work hard would demand more&nbsp;L-glutamine – since they’re responsible for creating it in the body. Instances during which our body comes under stress,&nbsp;makes&nbsp;it require additional glutamine.&nbsp;</p><img alt width=2917px height=100% loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/v2/app/uploads/sites/478/2019/04/Blog-image-improvement-Untitled-Page-13-min_1606391166.jpeg fetchpriority=auto style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2 id=food>Food Sources&nbsp;</h2><p>Dietary sources of L-glutamine include a variety of foods, from animal foods like eggs and beef to vegetable sources like rice or corn. Due to this wide availability in food, following a healthy diet can provide adequate L-glutamine for most people. However, during exercise, L-glutamine production changes based on the type and intensity of activity.&nbsp;</p><p>Because L-glutamine is crucial for muscle building, increasing our levels via supplementation after exercise can be beneficial. L-glutamine supplementation may have a greater benefit on those who have less protein in their diets, like vegans or vegetarians. This is because they may naturally have less of this amino acid.&nbsp;</p><p>Many sports supplements are targeted towards strength training, but&nbsp;L-glutamine has potential benefits for both power exercise and endurance exercise.</p><img alt width=700px height=100% loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/v2/app/uploads/sites/478/2019/04/egg-min_1606391928.jpg fetchpriority=auto style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>&nbsp;<h2 id=benefits>Benefits&nbsp;</h2><h3>Quick Recovery&nbsp;</h3><p>Research has shown that athletes can benefit from L-glutamine supplementation to decrease muscle soreness and faster recovery time.&nbsp;</p><p>This amino acid plays a crucial role in controlling glucose (energy) uptake by the muscles after exercise, which can help restore their energy stores for your next workout. When your muscles have optimal glucose stores, you can perform better and take longer to fatigue.&nbsp;</p><p>Long periods of strenuous training have been shown to decrease blood glutamine levels, making it a potentially useful supplement for your post-workout nutrition plan.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Increased Lean Body Mass and Power&nbsp;</h3><p>When combined with creatine, L-glutamine supplementation has been shown to increase lean body mass and power with endurance exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>Studies have shown additional potential benefits, such as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Limited strength loss and reduced muscle soreness</li><li>Feeling less fatigued</li><li>Longer time until exhaustion in endurance exercise</li></ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Boost in Immunity&nbsp;</h3><p>Additionally, athletes who follow intense training schedules tend to have weakened immune systems due to the constant physical stress of high-intensity exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>Research shows that L-glutamine plays a role in both immune cell production (having enough to fight off germs) and the gut’s function as a physical barrier to infection. For these reasons, there may be a potential benefit to your immune system from an L-glutamine supplement as well.</p><h2 id=dosage>Dosage&nbsp;</h2><p>Intakes of 20-30g of glutamine or 0.65g/kg of body mass have been used in research studies and not shown any ill effects in short term use. However, you likely only need 3-5g&nbsp;daily to meet your body’s needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Myprotein&nbsp;offers several glutamine options - follow the packaging dosage to use 1-2 scoops per day.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=timing>Timing&nbsp;</h2><p>Because glutamine has shown to be in lower concentrations after intense training sessions, it’s popular to take it after a workout to help your muscles to rebuild and grow - but it’s not the only time of day to use it.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be taken on its own or as part of your post-workout protein shake since protein is another key for muscle recovery and building. Glutamine’s role in controlling glucose (energy) usage during workouts means it can also be useful to take it before a workout.&nbsp;</p><p>For these reasons, the timing is primarily based on your goals - if you struggle with energy and pushing through to finish your workout, add it to your pre-workout shake or meal.&nbsp;</p><p>If your goal is simply to boost your recovery and muscle turnover, take it with your post workout shake. If you’re training for long periods of time, you can even add it to water that you sip throughout the workout.</p><h2 id=effects>Potential Side Effects&nbsp;</h2><p>L-glutamine&nbsp;is&nbsp;partially metabolized to ammonia, which can increase blood ammonia and blood glutamate levels in high doses.&nbsp;</p><p>Studied doses of glutamine ranged from 5-28 grams per day, with a published observed safe level of a maximum of 14 grams per day, and no increase in plasma ammonia levels.&nbsp;</p><p>There are limited potential sides effects of taking&nbsp;L-glutamine every day, as it’s both made by the body and present in many foods.&nbsp;</p><p>Always consult your doctor before taking L-glutamine or other supplements if you have any concerns.</p><h2 id=FAQS>FAQs&nbsp;</h2><h2>What are the benefits of L-Glutamine?&nbsp;</h2><p>The benefits of L-Glutamine include faster recovery and between workouts, increased lean body mass and power, and a boost to your immune system.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is L-Glutamine?&nbsp;</h2><p>L-Glutamine is a non-essential amino acid, meaning your body produces it naturally.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;when your body is under metabolic stress,&nbsp;supplementing&nbsp;it may be beneficial.&nbsp;</p><h2>When should I take L-Glutamine?&nbsp;</h2><p>The best time to take L-Glutamine is&nbsp;pre- and post-workout, in order to replenish stores which are depleted as you train.</p><h2>Take Home Message&nbsp;</h2><p>L-glutamine is an important amino acid that plays many roles in our bodies regardless of our level of exercise. However, the stress that exercise puts on our body can deplete our&nbsp;L-glutamine levels, making it a useful supplement for athletes.&nbsp;</p><p>It shows many potential benefits to performance, recovery, and body mass, with limited side effects. It can also be useful to boost our immune system and help sustain adequate levels in those who follow low-protein diets.</p><h2>Looking for some more expert advice?</h2><p>READ THESE NEXT:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmito2O6urzRqKueoZ5jsLC5jq2fnrKfo7Jwv9Spp6WdnZq7tb%2BOpWSgpKWprq61zZ5ksKCRqXqqv4yiq2aalaOyp7XTrGSsoZSaeqayxZ6aratdmbymv4ydpmg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./pba-boybits-victoria-death-cause-and-obituary.html>&#171;&nbsp;PBA Boybits Victoria Death Cause And Obituary</a>
