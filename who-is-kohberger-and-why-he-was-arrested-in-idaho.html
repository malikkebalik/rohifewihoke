Around 3 o’clock on Friday morning, a Swat team raided the Chestnuthill Township, Pennsylvania, the residence where 28-year-old Bryan Kohberger was staying and apprehended him.</p><p>According to the reports, police have matched Kohberger’s DNA to samples recovered at the scene of the killings and they also seized a white Hyundai Elantra matching the description of a car they had been trying to locate.</p><p><strong>You can read about these topics also:</strong></p><h2>Who is Kohberger?</h2><p><strong>Kohberger was a criminal justice doctoral candidate at Washington State University in Pullman</strong>, just a short drive from Moscow, where the killings took place. Earlier this month, he finished his first semester of college. Not long after his arrest, the university removed a graduate student page that included his name and images of a police raid on the apartment where he had been staying surfaced online.</p><p>At DeSales University in Center Valley, Pennsylvania he earned a master’s degree in criminal justice in 2022. Later, the school released a statement saying they had learned of his arrest and were devastated by this senseless tragedy. For his research survey on how emotions and psychological traits influence decision-making when committing a crime. Kohberger, while at DeSales reached out to a Reddit community for former prisoners for assistance.</p><p>Some of the questions he allegedly asked his victims and witnesses such as “Before making your move, how did you approach the victim or target?” took on a sinister tone in light of his alleged crimes. What were you feeling and thinking after you committed the crime? Before leaving the house did you make any plans to commit the crime?</p><p>Just what were your internal thoughts and emotions like at this time? The question is, Why did you pick that victim or target instead of others? For over six weeks after the killings, Kohberger appeared to evade the efforts of the Moscow Police, Idaho State Police and the FBI. During this time authorities provided scant details about their search other than the fact that they were looking for a knife, the apparent murder weapon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Who-is-Kohberger-1.jpg><p>By Friday night neither a motive for Kohberger’s crimes nor evidence of any prior connection between him and any of his victims had emerged. Besides his compulsive overeating, not much is known about his character. A former classmate of Kohberger’s told that he began boxing during his senior year of high school and studied criminal justice in the hopes of one day becoming a police officer.</p><p>It seemed like he was constantly picking fights and intimidating those around him. Because he was completely different, we began isolating him from our group of friends, <a href=# rel=noopener>Nick Mcloughlin</a> said. According to court records, Kohberger made a brief appearance in a Monroe County court on December 31, where he was ordered held without bail and is scheduled to be extradited after a hearing on January 3.</p><p><strong>Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, all twenty years old, were found stabbed to death in their beds while sleeping in their off-campus home on November 13.</strong> His arrest comes nearly seven weeks after their murders. Moscow’s small college community was shaken by the first murders in seven years.</p><p>This week, police said they had received over 20,000 tips related to the investigation. The four college students were reportedly killed between 3 and 4 a.m. but their bodies weren’t found until hours later when roommates Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke called the police out of concern for their missing companions.</p><h2><strong>Is Kohberger a student in Idaho?</strong></h2><p>According to a statement on DeSales University’s website, <strong>Kohberger attended the university both as an undergraduate and a graduate student.</strong> According to its Facebook page, DeSales University is a Catholic institution located in Pennsylvania. A university spokesperson said he earned his bachelor’s degree in 2020 and his master’s degree in criminal justice this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Who-is-Kohberger-2.jpg><p>Before his arrest, a student researcher named Bryan Kohberger from DeSales University posted by asking participants in a study to understand how emotions and psychological traits influence decision-making when committing a crime.</p><p>The original, now-deleted post read: “In particular, this study seeks to understand the story behind your most recent criminal offense, with an emphasis on your thoughts and feelings throughout your experience.” A representative from Northampton Community College also told that Kohberger attended the school and earned an A.A. in psychology in 2018.</p><h2><strong>When Kohberger arrested by police?</strong></h2><p><strong>A white Hyundai Elantra, model years 2011-2013 was reportedly spotted in the immediate area of the crime scenes earlier this month</strong> prompting authorities to appeal to the public for information. After that call, an unprecedented number of tips came in, police said. Two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation say they were able to track Elantra’s ownership back to Kohberger.</p><p>According to the sources who also detailed the authorities’ belief that Kohberger fled the area and went to Pennsylvania after the crime, his DNA matched DNA that was recovered from the scene of the crime. According to the same sources, the FBI had been keeping tabs on the suspect for days prior to his arrest in the area where he was eventually located.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Who-is-Koherger.jpg><p>One law enforcement official claims that Kohberger drove the Elantra across the country and spent Christmas with his family in Pennsylvania. Police in Moscow, Idaho and prosecutors worked together to build a case against Kohberger that warranted an arrest warrant during which time Kohberger was under constant surveillance. According to the law enforcement source authorities followed Kohberger all over the country and kept tabs on his parents’ home.</p><h2>Investigators looking for background on a suspect</h2><p><strong>Authorities are still keen to hear from anyone with information about Kohberger. </strong>For Latah County’s top prosecutor, <a href=# rel=noopener>Bill Thompson</a>, Friday’s developments mark a new beginning rather than the investigation’s conclusion. Please spread the name of the person who has been charged with these crimes and appeal to the general public for any witnesses or information they may have.</p><p><strong>Must read our previous articles on these topics:</strong></p><p>Report anything you know about him to help the investigators and ultimately our office and the court system understand fully everything there is to know about not only the individual but also what happened and why Thompson said. As evidenced by archival documents, Kohberger was arraigned on a Friday morning and he has another court hearing in Pennsylvania on Tuesday regarding his extradition.</p><p><strong>Final Lines</strong></p><p>In this article, we updated you with all the details related to Who is Kohberger.
