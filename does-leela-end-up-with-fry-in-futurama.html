Which becomes his present, a reality he embraces with the hope of uniting with the one he now considers his soulmate.</p><p data-characters=93 data-current-count=93 data-injectable=false>The short answer to the question, “Does Leela end up with Fry in Futurama?” is “yes.”</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>The long answer is, funny enough, tied to their multiverse which was a thing before multiverses became a thing everywhere you look.</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Voiced masterfully, gracefully, whole-heartedly by Kathy Segal and Billy West, respectively, Leela and Fry is a love story that spans decades, nay, millennia.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>Worlds, galaxies, black holes, inner and outer space, their tale has it all.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Did they wind up together? Will their future be explored in the impending new episodes of Futurama, rebooted (revived?) for, let’s say, the eleventeenth time? The news is that Futurama is coming back in 2023 on Hulu <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with all of the original main cast in tow.</a></p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Hop onboard the Planet Express, and let’s revisit a few of the times Fry and Leela got together — or nearly did — throughout the history of Futurama, as told by the four favorite best Leela and Fry episodes to date.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=77 data-injectable=false>We present Fry and Leela, or, “A Lee-love story for hopeless Frymantics.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Seems like they’re soulmates</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>When Phillip J. Fry is stung by a poisonous bee, we are led to believe he’s dead, or in a fugue state, on the brink of perishing, and trying to reach Leela through her dreams.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Throughout “The Sting” in season four, a season which actually contains quite a lot of will-they/won’t-they, the tug of heartstrings from both characters resonates strong.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Though there are early instances that play to the connection between mutant and time traveler, this is the one where you see that Leela’s world collapses around her when she thinks she’s losing Fry. And that Fry is the one thing that can keep her from despair, and death.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>Slowly, Leela is losing her grip on sanity and reality, and we’re led to believe it’s because she’s ingesting spacy honey, leading to her dreams and delusions.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>The episode takes us as far as to having Fry regenerated as himself thanks to royal jelly and his um, various fluids left on a couch. This starts to unravel as Leela does as well, and the line between reality and dream is completely blurred as Leela awakens in a room where the walls and floor are the Planet Express crew telling her “you killed Fry,” leading her to the brink of a Romeo and Juliet-style ending of slipping away forever via ingestion.</p><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>Peeled back, we see that it’s actually Leela who suffered the worst of the poisoned sting, and she is ripping through nightmares and Inception-level dramatic dreams. Fry continuously talks to Leela while she’s in a coma state, hoping that his presence will keep her connected to reality and life itself, and he appears in her dreams telling her she has to wake up, which shakes her out of the fantasy she’s in where Fry has come back to life, but it’s actually him trying to tell her to wake up from her coma. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>When we see him sitting there, it’s clear he’s been sitting there all along, begging whatever heavens may exist, to get her awake alive, and the happy tears may or may not start to flow. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Well, she wakes up, and hand-in-hand, we’re left to believe the power of their bond, their love, brings her back to the conscious world.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>Lovingly, the tale doesn’t say whether this put them together for good, or whether it was just another stepping-stone on their way to being happily wed.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Turmoil in paradise</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Leela tells Fry she loves him. Fry tells Leela he loves her.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>And yet, it’s not the one, true Fry, as we come to learn in the season three episode “Parasites Lost” that Fry has a worm infestation that is making him a smarter, stronger, and more refined version of himself.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>As miniaturized versions of the Planet Express crew go into Fry’s body to try and remove the worms, Leela stays on the outside to distract Fry, who is unaware of the parasitic invasion.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Once he finds out, though, he at first ignores it, realizing that for the first time, Leela is paying attention to him and falling for him.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>Leela loves this new version of Fry, as he now has manners and learns to play the holophonor to impress her with a sonnet. And Leela successfully stops the crew from eliminating the worms so that the new version of Fry will remain forever.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Deep down in his guts (literally), Fry has to find out if her love for him is the real thing, or only tied to the worms, and he now goes inside himself to fight the worms, risking his own organs to force them to flee.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>Back to his somewhat doofus self, Fry has lost his strength and new intelligence, but sets out to try and learn the holophonor anyway and prove that he is the man that Leela fell in love with.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Appendage swap</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>The holophonor is back again. In the season four finale — which for more than half a decade was the series finale — Leela and Fry (ok, a holophonor-created image of them) wind up together.</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false>In the episode, Fry has unsuccessfully learned to play the futuristic instrument, and enlists help from the Robot Devil.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>In a game of chance, Fry will swap hands with any robot in the world and as luck has it, he wins the Robot Devil’s hands, which are able to artfully play the holophonor and Fry constructs an entire love story opera dedicated to her.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>This time, with his newfound (again) skill caused by an outer force on the outside instead of the worms inside him, Fry has no problem keeping the influencing agent to woo Leela.</p><p data-characters=626 data-current-count=626 data-injectable=true>Fry’s opera, however, flies a little too close to the sun as he insults the Robot Devil, who then demands his hands back or he’ll take Leela’s hand — in marriage. Just a few scenes earlier, Leela lost her hearing because of Bender’s antics with an air horn, and she, like Fry, wants good things between them and strikes a deal with the Robot Devil as well, but for one of his ears, and she doesn’t realize the agreement she’s struck, which puts them both in a precarious position when the Robot Devil makes his reveal while asking for his hands back. The opera then goes awry as Fry cannot play expertly anymore.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>After it all, Leela wishes for Fry to complete the opera, and he plays out a crude version of it where fans get their wish, just not in the way we all hoped.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>In his episode-ending opera, the two wind up together, kissing, and holding hands as they walk off and out of our lives for the first time as this was the then-finale of the show — at the time Fox had not renewed Futurama, and it turns out, it never aired on Fox again and left the airwaves for six years before rebooting on Comedy Central.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>A doozy of a heartbreaker/heart-warmer</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>In what will now be the penultimate series finale — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s been four series finales</a> so far, lol — it’s easier to understand what’s happening by watching the episode than trying to type it out in a way that makes total sense.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=142 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The last time Futurama ended, getting its cancellation from Comedy Central this time</a>, we’ll skip to the point — Leela and Fry get married.</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Sure, they are the only people left as alive and lucid people on the entire planet, as everyone else has been frozen in time, but they’re together and seemingly live out their lives happily ever after as can be.</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>The season seven and series finale episode, “Meanwhile,” has everything we want from Futurama, and then some.</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>This one’s a doozy, let’s get down to the nuts and bolts of it. &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>In the beginning, a Bender-caused accident at an amusement park — he hurls nuts and bolts on the ride — causes Leela to launch into space and Fry believes he’s lost her forever. She survives, though, spurring Fry to commit to proposing to her.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>The Professor has created a device that rewinds time 10 seconds at a time, and another device, a bubble, that protects anyone inside of it from the effects of the device.</p><p data-characters=256 data-current-count=256 data-injectable=false>Fry steals the device and uses the short-term time traveling to steal diamonds and construct a wedding ring for Leela. In lieu of a proposal and answer, Fry tells Leela to meet him on top of the Vampire State Building at 6:30pm if she accepts his proposal.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Not realizing his watch isn’t accurate anymore from all his time traveling, Fry sees that Leela is 32 minutes late and by his assumption, not showing up and rejecting his proposal. Heartbroken, he leaps from the tower.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>As he is falling, he sees Leela is coming to accept the proposal, and the real time — as he sees on the tower —is only 6:25, not 7:02 as he thought.</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>It’s too late, though, as he has been falling longer than 10 seconds and cannot rewind time back to before he jumps. Fry spends what must seem like an eternity in a hopeless loop of realizing he blew it, and his love is there, in love with him, and he can’t do anything to undo things and is doomed to never have her.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=175 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, there are a number of things at play that threaten the universe because time is looping repeatedly now with Fry hitting the button every 10 seconds during his fall.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>The Professor worries the universe could be damaged, and that anyone in the bubble could be hurt or killed if they now left the bubble during these loops.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>The crew tries to go save Fry but they are devastatingly just a little too late, as Fry has grown tired and lets go of the button, plummeting to his death. A heartbroken Leela picks up the device, though, and starts to loop back 10 seconds from that moment when he is still alive as they try to figure out how to save him.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>The Professor is killed in his attempt to stop Leela. Then, Leela and Bender figure out how to save Fry, but Fry’s life-saving fall onto an airbag smashes the device once and for all, freezing time for everyone except our star-and-time-crossed lovers.</p><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>They have their long-awaited wedding, confirming that yes, Leela and Fry do wind up together in Futurama.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>Our saga isn’t done yet though. After decades living together, the couple go back to the fateful meeting place and realize that the Professor is not dead, but is in what we’ll call an alternate dimension and he’s searching for the device, but Fry has the pieces of it still.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Once together again, the Professor is able to reconstruct and fix the device, but with one exception of course — once he pushes it, order and time will be restored in the universe, but back to the moment before he ever even conceived the device, thus rendering this entire love and marriage story to memories that will be lost.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>Even though they’ll lose their time and life together as husband and wife, the pair agree to the activation of the device, and are jolted back to the time before they were married, unaware of anything that happened.</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>So, then, they didn’t get together after all? It all depends on your perspective, and concept of reality, and love of, well, love.</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>Thus ends the series, again, with fans left to make up their own minds about what happened between Fry and Leela.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu8SsZKWdlaGubrHNnWSuqF2strW0jJ%2BpsmWZo3qnwdOuqZqlkWQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kelly-clarkson-s-ex-husband-wants-436k-per-month-in-support.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kelly Clarkson's Ex-Husband Wants $436K PER MONTH In Support</a>
