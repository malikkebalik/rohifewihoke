In her lawsuit she accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her in 1995. She claimed that in 1995 Weinstein lured her to his hotel room where he climbed on top of her, masturbated and forced her to give him oral sex. She claimed she immediately told her then agents at CAA, <a href=#>Bryan Lourd</a> and <a href=#>Kevin Huvane</a>, who allegedly told her not to speak out. In her lawsuit she accused CAA of breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. Miramax â€“ the company Weinstein co-founded with his brother <a href=# title="Bob Weinstein Net Worth">Bob Weinstein</a> â€“ and The Walt Disney Company were sued for alleged negligent supervision and retention. From the lawsuit:</p><p>"<strong>The men at CAA who represented Ormond knew about Weinstein. So too did Weinstein's employers at Miramax and Disney. Brazenly, none of these prominent companies warned Ormond that Weinstein had a history of assaulting women because he was too important, too powerful, and made them too much money.</strong>"</p><p>In response to the lawsuit CAA claimed that Ormond's lawyers had demanded a $15 million payment in exchange for her not taking her allegations against the agency public. Ormond was represented by CAA from 1995 through 1999.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>From 1988 to 1994, Julia was married to actor Rory Edwards, who she met during a production of "Wuthering Heights."

She sold this home in 2012 for $2.575 million. In 2014, Snapchat founder <a href=# title="Evan Spiegel Net Worth">Evan Spiegel</a> bought the home for $3.33 million.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>In 2010, Ormond won a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for "Temple Grandin," and in 2012, she was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for "Mad Men."
