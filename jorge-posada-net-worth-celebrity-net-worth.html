Puerto Rican former professional baseball player who has a net worth of $70 million. Jorge Posada played 17 seasons with the MLB's New York Yankees. Posada Villeta played baseball at Calhoun Community College in Alabama. He was a co-captain and all-conference player in 1991. A year earlier, the New York Yankees drafted Posada in the 24th round of the MLB Draft. He worked his way through the Yankees' farm system before making his Major League debut in September 1995. Posada played just one regular season game that year but ended up playing in the postseason as a pinch runner. He played limited time in 1996 before playing in more than 50 games during the 1997 season. He played 111 games during the World Series-winning 1998 season before re-signing with the Yankees in 1999. Posada retired in 2011 following a season as a designated hitter. Among his accomplishments, he won five Silver Slugger Awards and four World Series titles, and between 2000 and 2011 amassed more home runs and RBIs than any other catcher in the MLB. After retiring, he founded the Jorge Posada Foundation, which assists in research related to the birth defect craniosynostosis.</p><h2 id=career-earnings><strong>Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>During his MLB career, Jorge Posada earned $117 million in salary.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Jorge Posada was born as Jorge Rafael Posada Villeta on August 17, 1970 in San Juan, Puerto Rico to a Dominican mother and a Cuban father. He was educated at Alejandrino High School, where he played baseball and several other sports. Without SAT scores high enough to get into a four-year college, Posada accepted an offer at Calhoun Community College in Decatur, Alabama. There, he played college baseball under head coach Fred Frickie, and was voted the best hitter in 1990.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings-in-minors><strong>Career Beginnings in the Minors</strong></h2><p>In the 1990 MLB draft, Posada was drafted by the New York Yankees as an infielder. For his first professional season, he played second base with the minor league Oneonta Yankees, recording a .235 batting average with four home runs. Later, in 1992, Posada was switched to the position of catcher and played for the Greensboro Hornets. He finished the season with a .277 batting average, 12 home runs, and 58 RBIs. Posada began the 1993 season with the <a href=# title="Prince William Net Worth">Prince William</a> Cannons, hitting 17 home runs. As a result of his success, he was promoted to the Albany-Colonie Yankees. Posada was promoted again in 1994, this time to the Columbus Clippers, with which he continued to play for the subsequent two years.</p><h2 id=new-york-yankees-1995-2005><strong>New York Yankees, 1995-2005</strong></h2><p>Posada made his MLB debut with the Yankees in 1995 in the ninth inning of a September game. Although he only played in that one game during the regular season, he was included on the Yankees' postseason roster and played in Game 2 of the ALDS. In 1996, Posada appeared in eight games, and despite not being in the postseason was given a championship ring after the Yankees won the World Series at the end of the year. The next season, Posada appeared in 60 games and recorded a .250 batting average with six home runs. Advancing to the ALDS, the Yankees fell to the Cleveland Indians. Posada improved his performance in 1998, batting .268 and scoring 17 home runs and 63 RBIs. Again making it to the postseason, the Yankees took their run all the way to another World Series title. The team went on to win two more consecutive World Series in 1999 and 2000. In the latter year, Posada won his first of five Silver Slugger Awards.</p><p>Making it back to the World Series in 2001, the Yankees ultimately fell to the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2002, the team made it to the ALDS, where they were defeated by the Anaheim Angels. Posada went on to have one of his best seasons in 2003, hitting a career-high 30 home runs and batting .281. The Yankees once again made it to the World Series, but lost to the Florida Marlins. In 2004, the team was defeated by the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS, and in 2005 lost to the Angels in the ALDS.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-215046 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Jorge-Posada.jpg alt="Jorge Posada Net Worth" width=594 height=420 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-215046 class=wp-caption-text>Jim McIsaac/Getty Images</p><h2 id=new-york-yankees-2006-2011><strong>New York Yankees, 2006-2011</strong></h2><p>Posada's 2006 season was his best since 2003, as he recorded a .277 batting average with 23 home runs and 93 RBIs. However, 2007 proved to be an even stronger year, with Posada batting .338 and recording career highs in hits (171) and doubles (42). He capped it off with his fifth and final Silver Slugger Award. After re-signing with the Yankees in the offseason, Posada was placed on the disabled list for most of the 2008 season. Returning in 2009, he got into a major brawl with Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Jesse Carlson that resulted in both players being suspended for three games. Despite the setback, Posada joined the Yankees for the postseason and their World Series victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.</p><p>In 2010, Posada notched his 1,000th career RBI in a game against the Kansas City Royals. He finished the regular season batting .248 with 18 home runs, and went on with the Yankees to the ALCS. In 2011, his final year in the MLB, Posada recorded a .235 batting average with 14 home runs and 44 RBIs. He advanced with the Yankees to the ALDS, where they lost to the Detroit Tigers. Posada decided to retire in early 2012.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Posada married softball pitcher Laura Mendez in early 2000; they had met a few years earlier on the field when Posada was umpiring in women's softball games, and later crossed paths at a party. Mendez went on to become an attorney. The couple has two children named Jorge and Paulina. Jorge was born with the birth defect craniosynostosis, for which Posada founded the Jorge Posada Foundation to fund research. He also released a charity wine and penned an autobiography entitled "The Beauty of Love: A Memoir of Miracles, Hope, and Healing."</p><h2 id=florida-mansion><strong>Florida Mansion</strong></h2><p>In 2010 Jorge and his wife paid $6.25 million for an oceanfront mansion in the Old Cutler Bay community of Coral Gables. The seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom mansion spans nearly 12,000 square feet of living space. The Posadas listed the home for sale in September 2022 for $19.9 million. For some reason they removed the listing just a few weeks later.</p><p>The Posadas previously lived in a 9,000 square foot Tampa mansion on two acres, which they custom built in 2003. They sold this home in 2021 for $3.5 million after listing in originally in 2016 for $6 million. Here's a video tour of their former place:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWSlsCmrsClo2iin6e0pnnPqKqanJFiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./mike-williams-accident-bacterial-sepsis-cause-of-death-obituary-2023.html>&#171;&nbsp;Mike Williams Accident: Bacterial Sepsis Cause Of Death Obituary 2023</a>
