Hit the comments and let us know your thoughts.&nbsp; Check out a sneak peek of tonight’s episode below!</p><p>LIVE RECAP HERE!</p><p>The show opens on a beach covered with debris from Superstorm Sandy. Bones finds a container filled with gooey human remains. Blech! Bones said the body in the tank reminds her of a ship in the bottle her Dad gave her as a child. Bones IDs the victim as a male and Hodgins waxes rhapsodic on conspiracy theories, hoping it’s an alien.</p><p>Cam’s dating a new guy after dumping her daughter’s gynecologist (gross) but won’t tell Angela any deets on the dude other than to let her know they’re shagging…</p><p>Vaziri and Hodgins are trying to figure out how to get the victim out of the podlike container he’s trapped in, so they break out the laser and cut a hole in it. Hodgins leans in to sniff the bloody sludge and passes out. Vaziri hits the contamination alarm and tries to recover his lab buddy.</p><p>They revive Hodgins after just 52 seconds – he’s embarrassed – especially when it’s revealed he got a snootful of CO2 which was a total rookie move. Bones takes a guess at cause of death and they look at missing teeth. Hodgins is assigned to assess what’s floating in the blood soup and Angela takes the skull off for reconstruction.</p><p>At home, Sweets, Booth and Bones discuss the case. Sweets thinks the smashed out teeth could be a sign they were trying to conceal ID of the victim. Bones is reading a children’s book because she says she’s thinking of writing one. Sweets quips that it’ll be hard to work a murder in. Bones is awkwardly amused.</p><p>In the lab, Hodgins is trying to figure out what made the pod by experimenting on turkeys. Lovely episode for a few days before Thanksgiving. Gross. Cam shares that Vaziri wrote a book of poetry. Hodgins flips through it with some interest.</p><p>They found a stamp on a piece of wood that turns out to be from a lumber mill. They bring in the facial reconstruction photo to the mill and a sales girl IDs him as a customer – she says he was a crime scene cleanup guy she calls “Lucky” aka Charles Millner.</p><p>The salesgirl gets teary and reveals she had a thing with Lucky but that he was going to leave his wife for her. She says Lucky told her his wife was dangerous and unstable. She dissolves into tears over her ostensibly dead adulterous lover…</p><p>Booth is questioning Lucky’s wife and find it ironic that he ended up like one of the bodies he cleans up. Booth asks if she knew about his affair with lumber girl – she reveals she’s wife number four, so she has no illusions. She says she’s not angry about the affair, but angry that she doesn’t know how she’ll support herself and that her son Davey won’t have Lucky in his life any more. Booth tells her he needs to talk to Davey. She asks Booth how she’ll be able to tell him they’re alone again.</p><p>Angela shows Bones the reconstruction of the damage done to the skull. She’s running scenarios using common crime scene clean up tools. Angela tells Bones Faziri’s a poet and Bones says she knew – she found a poem he’d written in Farsi on the back of a report. She said it was beautiful and very sexual. They find a couple of tools they like for the murder weapon and decide the claw hammer looks best. Bones quotes something in another language – it was one of his poems.</p><p>Faziri tells Hodgins he got in trouble back in Iran for his poetry – it was about love, freedom and sexuality. He says he can’t go home again – he had to flee or be arrested for his writing. Hodgins is envious that Faziri is a political refugee. He seems to find it cool.</p><p>Hodgins found some super-duper cleaning agents that helped break down the body rapidly. Looks like another indicator the murder was done at a murder clean-up site. Sweets interviews Davey and finds the boy unsurprised about his step-dad’s philandering. He asks if he’s good at cleaning up evidence and Davey says he didn’t kill him. Sweets says maybe his Mom killed Lucky and he cleaned up the crime. Davey points him toward a competitor crime scene cleaner.</p><p>At chez Booth, they talk crime scene. Sweets wants Booth to wrap up leftovers and Booth angrily refuses. Bones defends Sweets long-term stay with them and quotes psych issues from a textbook he left lying around. He’s frustrated with their psycho-analysis.</p><p>Sweets shows them the owner of Grim Sweeper Cleaners – Melvin – that he likes for the crime. He was a competitor who argued with Lucky over jobs and had a running dispute at the time of Lucky’s murder. Melvin comes in for an interview with Sweets and he’s got blood on him from a crime scene clean-up.</p><p>He tells them the lawsuit was dropped awhile back and reveals they were about to launch a partnership and that he had no reason to murder him. He points the finger back at Davey who didn’t want the partnership to happen.</p><p>They want to check his tools for blood and he tells them all of his tools are covered in bloods. He says to check Davey’s tools. Davey’s tools are clean and Melvin’s are covered in work blood. Hodgins compares the plastic that may have melted to form the pod and concludes that Lucky’s plastic sheeting formed the pod, so he was likely killed at one of his work sites.</p><p>Cam has Faziri’s poetry book and she spots her name in Farsi and asks him to read the poem he wrote for her. He recites it from memory and it’s beautiful. You can see her melting on the inside as he recites it. Hodgins walks up on them. She says she didn’t understand it and he tells her he thinks she did. Hodgins gasps and reveals his presence.</p><p>Cam says the lack of blood on Davey’s tools could be incriminating. Bones said that he may have cleaned his tools because he wants to do a good job. She said that it’s suspect that Melvin mentioned her by name when he told Sweets to check Davey’s tools.</p><p>They isolated the crime scene jobs to one where the cheap wood was used. Bones said it’s ironic that their job is to find evidence and the cleaners’ job is to destroy it.</p><p>Faziri tells Hodgins to keep a lid on it. Hodgins says he knows they’re a couple. Faziri begs him to be quiet. No wonder Cam didn’t want Angela to know who she’s boinking – it’s a workplace romance!!</p><p>Booth, Bones and Davey come into a house where there was a home invasion murder. Davey brags about how bloody and gross it was and how clean they got it. Davey said he had no problem with the partnership with Melvin. Davey said Lucky sent him home early from the crime scene in question because he was expecting a delivery.</p><p>Booth asks Davey about lumber-girl Renee and he confirms he knows her and she’s a skank. Renee’s called in and she said she delivered flooring, but then Lucky sent her packing because he was too busy. She says she loved him and didn’t kill him. Renee accuses the wife and son – saying wifey killed him and Davey leaned him up.</p><p>Angela and Hodgins share a romantic drink on the roof. He tells her he translated one of Faziri’s poems and he reads it to her. The translation is terrible. Angela says Bones told her it was beautiful. From their perch on the roof, they see Cam and Faziri smooching by the reflecting pool. Hodgins reveals he knew and Angela’s mad that she didn’t tell him. He tells her he promised his friend and she gets a little more understanding. They agree to keep it quiet and not tell anyone.</p><p>They bring Melvin in to see the home invasion crime scene and he admits he was there to discuss their impending merger. Bones likes Melvin for the job and keeps accusing him. He tells her there’s no evidence – that whoever cleaned up the crime scene destroyed all the evidence so there’s nothing there to implicate him.</p><p>Bones accepts the challenge and has the FBI and the squint team go to work! We get a rap-fueled evidence searching montage that’s a bit odd. They tear out the walls, the flooring and search it all. They tear the house down to its skeleton. Booth tells Melvin he heard about the money left in the house after the killing and wanted it and that’s why he killed Lucky. Melvin mocks them and tells them too bad. He leaves Booth and Bones very unhappy!</p><p>At the house, Booth wakes Sweets to leave Christine’s baby monitor with him because they’re researching a theory. As soon as he leaves, you can hear her crying on the monitor. Sweets is not a happy camper.</p><p>At the alleged crime scene, Bones tells Booth about the antics of a charlatan shaman who could make the floor bleed. She raises blood from the concrete with a high heat dryer. Cam affirms it was Lucky’s blood at the crime scene, but they still need to tie it to a killer. Angela finds a denser pattern in the blood that forms four spots.</p><p>Bones says it’s knee marks and indicates an artificial knee. Angela measures the tibia. Bones conjectures that Melvin is the killer if he’s got a fake knee. They call Melvin in and show him the bloody knee prints. Booth tells him knee prints are as individual as fingerprints. Bones comes in and slaps down the stack of cash they found at Melvin’s house.</p><p>Melvin said he knows the drill – they bring suspects in to get them to confess. Booth says they brought him in for another reason. Bones grins and says, “Gotcha!” and Booth arrests him for the murder.</p><p>On the roof having more wine, Hodgins continues to read translations of Faziri’s poems that are hilariously bad. Angela said maybe the poems are bad and Hodgins said no way – not with the way Cam was looking at him when he read the poem to her.</p><p>Bones doesn’t like that she was working a hunch on the case. They have a little repartee about love and walk out hand in hand. Cam asks Faziri if Hodgins will keep their secret and he says she’ll tell Angela and that Angela will tell Bones. He tells her he’s sorry because he knows she wants to keep it a secret. She says she doesn’t want to keep it a secret at all. She wants to tell everyone, but she wants everyone to know. He says it’s poetic. Aww….</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaGtnkqS7pr%2BMrJyaq5%2Bjenl5xKmgrKeUmnp4edOhnGaan5l6qrqMrZ%2BeZaCksW6%2BxJyYqWVhZn56fZFo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jessica-parido-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jessica Parido Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
