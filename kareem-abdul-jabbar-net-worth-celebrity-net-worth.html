By the eighth grade, he was 6'8. Throughout his youth, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played basketball and excelled at the sport due to his size. At age 12, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was able to dunk.</p><p>When Kareem Abdul-Jabbar started attending high school, his basketball talents became obvious. His school team won the New York City Championships many times, and he contributed greatly to this successful run. Due to the fact that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar attended Power Memorial Academy, he earned the nickname "the tower from power." Eventually, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar broke many records during his high school basketball career.</p><h2 id=college-basketball><strong>College Basketball</strong></h2><p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar started by playing in UCLA's freshman team, although he quickly made the transition to varsity basketball. Media publications such as Sports Illustrated pointed to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as a future star. During this time, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar made a notable impact on the team's performance, which included a three-year run with only two losses. He also directly caused the dunk to be banned in college basketball because he was so proficient with this scoring method.</p><p>In 1968, he boycotted the US Olympic team and didn't attempt to join their squad. He also converted to Islam during this period and took an Islamic name. Later in 1968, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar took part in what became known as "the game of the century." The match between UCLA Bruins and the Houston Cougars was televised nationally for the first time in the history of college basketball, and over 50,000 fans watched the game live. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's team lost the game, although they later defeated Houston during the NCAA Tournament.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-168204 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/GettyImages-469602717.jpg alt="Kareem Abdul-Jabbar" width=594 height=426 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-168204 class=wp-caption-text>Ronald Martinez/Getty Images</p><h2 id=nba-career><strong>NBA Career</strong></h2><p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in 1969 for $1.4 million. During his first year in the NBA, the Bucks achieved second place in the Eastern division. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar also became the league's second-highest scorer. The next year, the Bucks won the championship and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the top scorer. After he won the championship in 1971, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar officially adopted his Islamic name. Eventually, he requested a transfer in 1974.</p><p>In 1975, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar transferred to the Lakers. He began strongly with a high points-per-game average. Although the team was playing well, they continued to be knocked out during the playoffs with each passing season. However, the future looked much brighter after the Lakers acquired <a href=# title="Magic Johnson Net Worth">Magic Johnson</a> in 1979. This paved the way for a dominant run during the 80s. With the help of Magic Johnson and the experience of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the LA Lakers went on an impressive run during their "dynasty," and won five championship titles.</p><p>During the early to mid-80s, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's career began to wane. He was entering his early 40s, and his body was struggling to perform because of his physically demanding role on the team. Much earlier, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had started doing yoga in order to maintain flexibility and strength. He also bulked up in an effort to hold his own in the center position. Additionally, he had become well-known for wearing protective goggles. This was due to the fact that his corneas were prone to scratches and impacts. He also developed an eye condition during this time.</p><p>In 1989, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced that he would retire at the end of the season. His impact on the world of basketball was so great that his retirement became a major event in the sport. Fans gave him various gifts – ranging from an Afghan rug to a yacht. He also received standing ovations at games. His career spanned 20 years, and at the time of his retirement, he held the record for most games ever played by a single player.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-299000 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-299000 class=wp-caption-text>Rachel Murray/Getty Images</p><h2 id=coaching><strong>Coaching</strong></h2><p>After his NBA career,&nbsp; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar assumed that his career path would naturally lead to coaching. However, his reputation created a lack of opportunities.&nbsp; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was very quiet and didn't talk to the press. Some had described him as an introvert. That being said,&nbsp; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did have some opportunities to contribute to the coaching process.</p><p>He worked as an assistant and mentor for the Los Angeles Clippers and the Seattle Supersonics. His one head coaching job was in the now-defunct United States Basketball League for the Oklahoma Storm. He won the championship with the team, but it didn't lead to his appointment as the new coach for Columbia University as he had hoped. He eventually worked as a scout for the New York Knicks. One of the high points of his career was working as a special assistant coach for the Lakers from 2005 to 2011.</p><h2 id=acting><strong>Acting</strong></h2><p>During his time in Los Angeles, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar appeared in many films and TV shows, mostly in cameo roles where he played himself.

In 2018, it was announced that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was one of the writers for the show Veronica Mars.</p><h2 id=books><strong>Books</strong></h2><p>Kareem is prolific author, contributing significantly to literature across various genres. His writings often reflect his deep insights into sports, history, social justice, and his personal experiences. Notable works include "Giant Steps," an autobiography that offers an intimate look into his life and basketball career, and "Writings on the Wall: Searching for a New Equality Beyond Black and White," where he addresses the complexities of race and politics in America. Abdul-Jabbar has also delved into fiction, co-authoring the "Mycroft Holmes" series, which reimagines Sherlock Holmes' brother in a historical mystery setting. His book "Coach Wooden and Me: Our 50-Year Friendship On and Off the Court" explores his relationship with the legendary UCLA coach John Wooden, blending sports memoir with life lessons. Each book showcases Abdul-Jabbar's intellectual depth, keen observational skills, and commitment to addressing important social issues, making him a respected voice both in and outside the world of sports.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has published many books, including those that detail his playing career and those on issues such as black history and rights. After marrying Habiba Abdul-Jabbar, he had three children before divorcing her in 1978. He has two other children.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>For many years, Kareem owned a stunning home in the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's Hawaiian house was actually built in 1986, three years before he played his last official game. Constructed especially for him on 3-acres of land, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's house was designed to accommodate his 7′ 2″ height.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>The three-bedroom home features soaring open-beam ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, hardwood floors, and lava rock fireplaces.<span class=Apple-converted-space> The</span> house is 5,912 square feet and in addition the main house, there is also a carriage house and a pavilion situated next to the large pool.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>The pool itself is 50-feet long and was custom built.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>It even has its own waterfall.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>A private pathway directs visitors towards Secret Beach.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>Birds and other wildlife wander the grounds regularly, as the property is a stone's throw from the National Wildlife Refuge.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar put the property on the market for $5.9 million in 2013. He sold the home in 2015 for $4.8 million. At some point in the subsequent years, Will and Jada Smith, who already owned a neighboring property, acquired Kareem's former house to create a lavish 7-acre estate. In September 2017 Will and Jada sold the combined estate for $12 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6OtjqSYq52VonqirsOuo6OZkpeus3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-1-thing-adam-driver-learned-from-lena-dunham.html>&#171;&nbsp;The 1 Thing Adam Driver Learned From Lena Dunham</a>
