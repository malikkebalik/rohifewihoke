has a net worth of $6 million. He is best known for his roles in the films "Back to the Future," "Bartleby," "Charlie's Angels," "Beowulf," and "Alice in Wonderland."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Crispin Hellion Glover was born on April 20th, 1964 in New York City. His father was actor Bruce Glover, and his mother was actress and dancer Marion Elizabeth Lillian Betty Krachey. His parents named him after the Saint Crispin's Day speech from William Shakespeare's play "Henry V." His middle name was the fake middle name his father would use instead of his given middle name, Herbert. His father is of English, Czech, and Swedish descent, and his mother was of Czech and German heritage.</p><p>When he was five, his parents moved to Los Angeles, and he grew up there as an only child. He attended the private Mirman School until ninth grade. For high school, he spent two years at Venice High and his senior year at Beverly Hills High School. By the time he was thirteen, Glover already had his own agent. As an adolescent, he landed guest roles on television shows including "Happy Days," "Hill Street Blues," and "Family Ties." Due to his concern of being confined to a television series or character, he began seeking roles in films instead, and in 1983, he made his on-screen debut in the teen comedy "My Tutor." This role came just one year after he graduated high school in 1982.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>In 1984, he landed a supporting role in the horror film "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter" as well as a part in the satirical comedy "Teachers." He then worked with director Trent Harris on his film "The Beaver Trilogy." The film was composed of a series of short absurdist vignettes filmed over the course of five years. Glover appears in the third vignette and plays a character who is eccentric and madly obsessed with <a href=# title="Olivia Newton-John Net Worth">Olivia Newton-John</a>.</p><p>While he had already gotten a successful start to his acting career, his role as Marty McFly's father in the 1985 classic "Back to the Future." Glover is actually three years younger than Michael J. Fox who played the role of his son, Marty. For the sequels, Glover was unable to come to an agreement with the producers regarding the character's appearance in subsequent films, so his character's screen time was reduced, and his role was recast. Old footage from the first film was used for the second, and his replacement wore makeup, prosthetics, and shots of him were visually obscured. Because he didn't give his permission for his likeness to be used in the sequel, Glover sued the producer, <a href=# title="Steven Spielberg Net Worth">Steven Spielberg</a>.

The main house has 17 bedrooms. The property dates back to the 17th century and Crispin purchased the home so he could build his own sets on the grounds for future film productions. He converted the stables into an 18,000 square-foot production space. He also acquired a flock of peacocks to roam the grounds, today there are more than 30. The property's two ponds feature a dozen swans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLCztdKpoKdll6G8t7HRZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-much-money-does-wes-anderson-make-latest-income-salary.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Much Money Does Wes Anderson Make?
