That relationship is said to have inspired many songs from the Third Eye Blind album "Out of the Vein". He also dated <a href=#>Vanessa Carlton</a>.

Shortly after he was born, he moved with his family to Wisconsin, where his father taught political science at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. Later, when Jenkins was six, the family moved back to California, settling in Palo Alto. His parents divorced the next year. As a teenager, Jenkins went to Henry M. Gunn Senior High School, graduating in 1983. It was while in high school that he first began seriously playing music, which he did with a band called Fast Forward that consisted of students from the nearby Stanford University. After the group disbanded, Jenkins and one of the band's members teamed up with a new bassist to form the trio Splash. For his higher education, Jenkins attended the University of California, Berkeley, from which he graduated in 1987 with a BA in English literature.</p><h2 id=puck-natty><strong>Puck and Natty</strong></h2><p>In 1992, Jenkins formed the hip hop duo Puck and Natty with Detroit rapper Herman Anthony Chunn. Although the duo was short-lived, their song "Just Wanna Be Your Friend" became a moderate hit after it was used on the teen television show "Beverly Hills, 90210."</p><h2 id=third-eye-blind><strong>Third Eye Blind</strong></h2><p>Jenkins achieved his greatest career success with the alternative rock band Third Eye Blind, which he founded with Kevin Cadogan in 1993. Initially, the band performed gigs around the San Francisco Bay Area as a relatively unknown act. Eventually, in 1996, the group signed a deal with Elektra Records. Jenkins and Cadogan, the band's main songwriters and guitarists, were joined by bassist Arion Salazar and drummer Brad Hargreaves. Third Eye Blind went on to release its eponymous debut studio album in 1997. A significant success, the album reached number 25 on the Billboard 200 and went multi-platinum in the US. Moreover, it launched some of the band's biggest hit songs, including "Semi-Charmed Life" and "Jumper." Third Eye Blind's second album, "Blue," came out in 1999; it peaked at number 40 on the Billboard 200. The band scored its highest-charting album yet in 2003 with its third album, "Out of the Vein," which made it to number 12. Five years after that, Third Eye Blind released a digital-only EP entitled "Red Star" that was meant to be an appetizer for the group's fourth studio album, "Ursa Major." Released in 2009, "Ursa Major" became the band's newest highest-charting album when it peaked at number three.</p><p>Following a six-year hiatus, Third Eye Blind released its fifth studio album, "Dopamine," in 2015. It debuted at number 13 on the Billboard 200. The following year saw the release of the EP "We Are Drugs," which was followed two years later by the EP "Thanks for Everything." Third Eye Blind's sixth studio album, "Screamer," came out in 2019. Two years after that, the band released its seventh studio album, "Our Bande Àpart."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-207828 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Stephan-Jenkins.jpg alt="Stephan Jenkins Net Worth" width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-207828 class=wp-caption-text>Bryan Steffy/Getty Images</p><h2 id=other-music-endeavors><strong>Other Music Endeavors</strong></h2><p>Beyond Third Eye Blind, Jenkins made a featured appearance as a solo artist on the Run-DMC single "Rock Show" in 2001.
