This post has everything you need to know about her death.</p><h2><strong>Who Killed Selena Quintanilla?</strong></h2><p><strong>Yolanda Sald√≠var, head of Selena‚Äôs fan club killed Selena Quintanilla P√©rez in the morning of March 31, 1995, at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi, Texas.</strong> This happened not long after Sald√≠var was caught stealing thousands of dollars from Selena‚Äôs earnings.</p><p>It has been 28 years since Selena Quintanilla‚Äôs death and her fan shared a tweet on her 28th anniversary which is provided below:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Today is March 31, 2023, it‚Äôs the 28th anniversary of the death of Selena Quintanilla. i grew up listening to her songs & became a huge fan as a kid & now. she is & forever be a queen. we miss you beautifulüòñ. anything for selennnaaa‚ù§Ô∏è.</p><p><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GfPS70lOUb</a></p><p>‚Äî samantha ·•´·≠° (@bestofkadee_) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 31, 2023</a></p><h2><strong>How Did Yolanda Sald√≠var Kill Selena Quintanilla?</strong></h2><p>The fight between Selena and Sald√≠var started in the hotel room. People staying at the hotel said that Sald√≠var‚Äôs room was making loud noises. People told them they heard two women fighting about business. Selena told Sald√≠var that she could not be trusted and asked her to give back her cash papers.</p><p>After dumping Sald√≠var‚Äôs bag full of bank records on the bed, Selena saw the gun. <strong>It was aimed at Selena around 11:48 a.m.</strong> Sald√≠var shot Selena once in the lower right shoulder as she tried to run away. The bullet went through an artery and caused her to lose a lot of blood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Saldivar-Aimed-at-Selena-1.jpg><p>Selena was seriously hurt. She ran into the hallway and left a 392-foot (119 m) long trail of blood behind her.&nbsp;She was seen yelling, ‚ÄúHelp me! Help me!‚Äù while holding her chest. She was still being chased by Sald√≠var, who pointed the gun at her and called her a ‚Äúb_tch.‚Äù</p><p>The workers saw that Selena‚Äôs clothes were soaked in blood when she walked into the lobby.<strong> At 11:49 a.m. (CST), Selena fell to the floor while Barbara Schultz, the general manager of the hotel, called 911.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Selena-Quintanilla-1-1.jpg><p>Shawna Vela and Ruben DeLeon, who are in charge of sales at the hotel, tried to stop the blood. In one minute and 55 seconds, an ambulance got there. The doctors tore off Selena‚Äôs green sweater over the area where she was bleeding and put Vaseline on the wound, which stopped the bleeding on the surface.</p><p>Selena‚Äôs heart rate was very slow. To keep her blood moving, a nurse did cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After that, she was taken to the hospital and below you will read what was found in her reports.</p><p><strong>You can also check out our below posts related to Ray Mcneil & Gabriel Fernandez‚Äôs autopsy:</strong></p><h2><strong>What Was Selena Quintanilla‚Äôs Cause of Death?</strong></h2><p>When Selena was taken to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital by rescuers at 12:00 p.m., her pupils were fixed and dilated, there was no sign that her brain was working and she had no vital signs. <strong>She was pronounced clinically brain dead.</strong></p><p>The doctors were able to get her erratic heartbeat under control long enough to take her to the emergency room. After opening Selena‚Äôs chest and finding a lot of internal bleeding, doctors started giving her blood to try to get her blood flow back to normal.</p><p><strong>Selena‚Äôs right lung was hurt, her collarbone was broken and all of her veins were drained of blood.</strong> The hole in her chest was made bigger, drugs were put into her heart and pressure was put on her wounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Selena-Quintanilla-2.jpg><p>When heart surgeon Dr. Louis Elkins got to Memorial Hospital, he said he saw doctors making heroic efforts to bring Selena back to life.</p><p>The hollow-point bullet had cut in half a pencil-size artery leading from the heart. Six units of blood from the transfusion had also leaked out of her body. After Selena stopped breathing on her own, a breathing tube was put in her and a clamp was put on her gushing artery on her shoulder.</p><p>After 50 minutes, the doctors saw that the damage could not be fixed. <strong>Selena Quintanilla-P√©rez died of blood loss on March 31, 1995, at 1:05 p.m. (CST).</strong> She was 23 years old, 16 days before her 24th birthday.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>We made this post for informational purposes.
